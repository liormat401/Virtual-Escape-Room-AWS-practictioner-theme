# Virtual Escape Room AWS Practictioner Theme

# Opening:
Ive created an online escape room for my fellow friends in AWS RE/START program at Appleseed Academy ("עמותת תפוח") ,to challenge them with all the subjects we learn in the course- SQL,AWS cloud,Web,Binary and more.
The game required them to split into groups and work together to solve the puzzles, which we conducted via Zoom. Each group had a member who shared their screen.

Unfortunately, you can't play without an instructor that will set up the first challenge.
But if you insist and are willing to play differently - decipher the code and the next clue will be in a branch.
GOOD LUCK!

# Difficulties:
# 1. How in hell do I make an escape room? let alone,a VIRTUAL ONE?
   ChatGPT my friends,ChatGPT.
   I asked him to build an outline for my themed V.E.R; We didn't strike jack-pot at first,but we combined ideas to make unique and exciting puzzles. 
# 2. Where can I build my ideas?
  Again my friends-ChatGPT. I needed to know which websites offer free escape room tools. And the winner was:
  Genial.ly
   I Absolutely recommend making interactive games,escape rooms and even presentations on that platform.
# 3. Learning in short time using the new tool(for me)- genial.ly
  With help of Google,Youtube and a lot of common-sense- in a few hours I already started working on my game. The first few hours went on choosing a template.
# 4. Building The Actual Puzzles
   Well,for some I didn't need any other tools, but for the encrypted message or the crossword I definitely needed some guidance. For that I found some online generators that were great and made everything easier.
# 5. Making the game run independently
Unfortunately, due to the limited duration of the AWS Sand-Box, players won't be able to locate the specific S3 bucket for the first challege if the instructor didnt configure one in-time. As this game was designed as an educational activity, an instructor is necessary to guide players in their thought process and achieve the desired learning outcomes. *Therefore, I created the game with minimal hints to encourage critical thinking and problem-solving skills.*
